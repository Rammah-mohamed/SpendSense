## 🌍 Project Overview  

Companies are losing **30–60% of their SaaS budget** due to:  
- Duplicate tools across departments  
- Inactive licenses left unmonitored  
- Auto-renewals on underused subscriptions  

This project demonstrates how internal tools can help businesses **save real money**.  

I built this dashboard to showcase **problem-solving with frontend development** and **business-focused data visualization**.
